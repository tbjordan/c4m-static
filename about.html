          <h3>How we began</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>It started with a vison, a God-sized vision.  Four women, from different churches, backgrounds, communities, of different ages and seasons in life who were given a vision.  God was calling each of them to “Go and Bear Fruit” for Him in their local area.  Their calling was to begin a ministry in their community based on John 15:16, “For I have chosen you and appointed you to go and bear fruit”.
          </p>
          <p>This local ministry team is dedicated to studying and teaching God’s word together, believing that every believer in Christ is “chosen” to be His witnesses first in their homes, families, churches, and communities.  He equips us, through the empowering of His Holy Spirit, as His servants to “Go “and “Bear Fruit” as we walk out His plan for our life.  We walk out His plan through leading Bible studies in the fall, spring and summer in a home setting. We assist others in developing a personal “Discipleship” plan through their personal gifts and talents and encouraging all believers to see themselves as servants  through personal and in depth Bible studies in homes, churches and  communities.

          <h3>What we believe</h3>
          <hr>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <ul>
          <li>We believe the Bible is the true word of God. </li>

          <li>We believe in the Trinity, the Godhead 3 in one:  God the Father, God the Son and God the Spirit.</li>

          <li>We believe in the Virgin birth of Jesus Christ and in His Deity.</li>

          <li>We believe that Jesus Christ was crucified on the cross and died to make atonement for the sins of man.  Jesus Christ paid the penalty for sin for all peoples and gave His life as a substitute death for all.  His death is sufficient for all who come to Him, repenting of their sins, and believing in the saving power of Him.</li>

          <li>We believe in the bodily resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ.  That He was crucified, dead, and buried and the third day He rose again and was seen by many witnesses.  One day all believers in Christ Jesus will also receive God’s gift of grace and mercy in eternal life.</li>

          <li>We believe in life eternal and a judgement for unbelievers who reject Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.</li>

          <li>We believe in Christ’s return to earth to set-up His righteous kingdom and to judge the world in righteousness.</li>

          <li>We believe man was created in the image of God, by God and for God. He created them male and female.   Sin entered the world through Adam and Eve.  Sin is what separates us for God and life eternal.</li>

          <li>We believe marriage is a gift from God and the joining of one man and one woman.
          </li>

          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
          <ul>

          <li>We believe God in His mercy and love gives salvation to all who call upon His name.  Salvation comes through personal belief in His Son, Jesus Christ, confession of sins and repentance and turning away from sin.  Our salvation grants us entrance to God and fellowship with Him only through our personal belief that Jesus bore our sins in His own body upon the cross. Upon acceptance of Christ, believer’s will receive the empowering and filling of the Holy Spirit.  The Holy Spirit indwells believers and is their seal unto the Day of Redemption.  The seal says who we as believers belong to.</li>

          <li>We believe the Holy Spirit is responsible for the restoring from death into life and for the work of sanctification in the believer.</li>

          <li>We believe the church is the body of Christ, a spiritual organism made up of believers who are identified with Christ through water baptism and remember His death and salvation in the Lord’s Supper or Communion.</li>

          <li>We believe that all believers are called to be in this world but not of it.</li>

          <li>We believe in the Great Commission; that we are called to be witnesses for Christ, preaching and teaching the gospel to all people and having a personal relationship with Jesus through personal Bible study and through obedience to the Holy Spirit, which leads us into all truth.</li>
